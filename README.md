This notebook is used only for education purpose not for real data

Here you will learn a lot of things in 

# CNN model developmenet

## How to prepare datasets, 
## Reading the same numpy files that we did in last section /data and label/
## Doing normalization of feature data and adjust the label number.
## Train test split our dataset
## Data Augmentation
## Choosing pre-trainned model
## Declearning optimization and make model compile
## Train our model
## Ploting the graphic information of loss and accuracy
## Make Classification Report by calculating precision, recall, f1-score and accuarcy
## Draw a confusion matrix
## Save our model
## KFolding

# Chatbots

## Import corpus - is the training data needed for the chatbot to learn
## Preprocess the data - Convert all the data coming as an input to either upper or lowercase. This will avoid misrepresentation and misinterpretation of words if splt under lower or upper cases.
## Text case handling - it's the process of preprocessing data.
## Tokenization - Convert a sentence into individual collection of words.
## Stemming - is a process of finding similarities between words with the same root words
## Bag of Words (BOG) - process of converting words into numbers by generating vector embeddings from the tokens generated.
## One hot encoding - is a process by which categorical variables are converted into a form that ML algorithms use
## Trainning and Tasking
